# StockQuack
This is a project trying to build a duck chess engine using reinforcement lurning & alpha-beta prunning.
## How It's made 
### -Evaluator
    -Using Matiral & Position to cauculate evaluation
    -Matirial & Position scores are first set to a value, then changed(improved) by using reinforcement luring(rate of winnig) 
### -Deciding Moves
    -Using alpha-beta prunning & the evaluator to decide the best moves
